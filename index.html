              Spins are considered as a bonus and must be wagered before any
              winnings can be cashed out. The free games bonus is calculated as
              the total value of the winnings received through the use of the
              free games. The total value of such credit shall be subject to the
              wagering requirements set out below.
            </li>
            <li>
              Any and all free games bonus(es) shall be subject to the standard
              bonus policy detailed hereby.

            <li>
              Players, who initiate a deposit in order to receive free games as
              part of a deposit offer, MUST wager their deposit amount before
              initiating a withdrawal. Players who withdraw their deposit
              without wagering will lose the free games earned from the deposit
              or if used, any winnings earned from the free games.
            </li>
            <li>
              The above terms also apply to 50 spins ON YOUR FIRST DEPOSIT. For
              more details, please see our FAQ page.

          <p>
            Deposits may be withdrawn before a player’s wagering requirements
            have been fulfilled. However, if this occurs, all bonuses and
            winnings will be voided/removed from the player’s account. Players
            must contact support in order to withdraw their deposit.
          </p>
          <br />

          <p>
            Winnings received through the use of the free bonus (no deposit) or
            free spins shall not exceed £100. Any winnings which shall be made
            with the free bonus or free spins which exceeds the £100 maximum,
            shall be considered as nil, and shall not be recorded as winnings.
            Only the maximum winnings of £100 can be withdrawn by the Player
            subject to the terms specified in the Bonus Policy.
          </p>

          <p>
            When a bet abuses the betting system – regardless of which game it
            was placed on – it will not count towards a player’s wagering
            requirements. If the player placed single bets equal to or greater
            than £4 or £0.50 per line, or 15 percent of the bonus amount before
            the wagering requirements for the bonus have been met, we reserve
            the right to withhold any amount in excess of the player’s original
            deposit from a player’s withdrawal. In addition, if a player
            deposited with Skrill or Neteller and placed single bets equal to or
            greater than £2.50 of the bonus amount before the wagering
            requirements for the bonus have been met, we reserve the right to
            withhold any amount in excess of the player’s original deposit from
            a player’s withdrawal. If the player placed bets on any of the games
            which contribute 0% to the wagering requirement before the wagering
            requirements for the bonus have been met, we reserve the right to
            withhold any amount in excess of a player’s original deposit from a
            player’s withdrawal.
